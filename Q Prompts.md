# Q Prompts

Prompt-1
/dev I am creating a sample application that does following:
1/ it is deployed into a AWS ECS using Fargate
2/ it is a .net core application based on container image mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples:latest; an ECR repo should be created and use the ECR repo in the ECS task definition 
3/ it uses AWS RDS SQL Server as database layer and may connects to multiple RDS instances dynamicly
4/ it uses Tarraform as IaaS provisioning tool
5/ it creates multiple ECS services with different node and scaling configurations from same code base (the container image mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples:latest) 
6/ it has ALB at front to route incoming traffic based on sub-domains, with root domain https://definitiv.com.au/;  https://tenant1.definitiv.com.au/ goes to  ECS service tenant1 which connects to RDS SQL Server database tenant1, and  https://definitiv.com.au/ goes to  ECS service tenant2 which connects to RDS SQL Server database tenant2.
7/ it uses AWS Graviton-based compute with AWS Fargate Spot in ECS.
8/ it has AWS Distro for Open Telemetry installed and configured to be able to stream the logs and metrics to New Relic
9/ the container image should be stored in ECR
10/ use http rather than https for now
11/ add a git ignore file and add below items: .git .terraform .terraform.lock.hcl

Please create this application for me with detailed deployment code, including the VPC, ECS and services, Dockerfile, ECR repo, RDS, ALB and AWS Distro for Open Telemetry, all using Terraform codes.

Please create the files recommended in current folder

# Building and Pushing Container Images to ECR

To build and push your container image to Amazon ECR, follow these steps:

1. **Authenticate to Amazon ECR:**
```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region <your-region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<your-region>.amazonaws.com
```

2. **Build the Docker image:**
```bash
docker build -t <image-name> .
```

3. **Tag your image for ECR:**
```bash
docker tag <image-name>:latest <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<your-region>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>:latest
```

4. **Push the image to ECR:**
```bash
docker push <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<your-region>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>:latest
```

Replace the placeholders:
- `<your-region>`: Your AWS region (e.g., us-east-1)
- `<your-account-id>`: Your AWS account ID
- `<image-name>`: Local name for your Docker image
- `<repository-name>`: Name of your ECR repository

Note: Make sure you have:
- AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate credentials
- Docker installed and running on your machine
- Required permissions to push to ECR
